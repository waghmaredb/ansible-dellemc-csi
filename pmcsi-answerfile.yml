# this section has the details on myvalues.yaml file

# "unisphere" defines the Unisphere endpoint, with full URL, typically leveraging HTTPS. This should include the port number as well (the default is 8443)
# clusterPrefix defines a prefix that is appended onto all resources created in the Array. Should be unique per K8S/CSI deployment
# volumeNamePrefix defines a prefix that is prepended to volumes.
# "controllerCount" defines the number of PowerMax controller nodes to deploy to
# "portGroups" defines the set of existing port groups that the driver will use
# "arrayWhitelist", if set, defines a set of arrays that will be exposed via the CSI Driver. if set to an empty string, all arrays known to Unisphere will be exposed
# "grpcMaxThreads" is an integer string which sets the maximum number of current grpc
# "skipCertificateValidation" determines if the driver is going to skip verification of TLS certificates while connecting to Unisphere RESTAPI interface
# "enableBlock" enables Block Volume Capability, which is experimental. Do not enable without contacting support.
# "transportProtocol" can be "FC" or "FIBRE" for fibrechannel, "ISCSI" for iSCSI, or "" for autoselection.
# "powerMaxDebug" enables low level and http traffic logging between the CSI driver and Unisphere.
# "storageClass.name" defines the name of the storage class to be defined.
# "storageClass.symmetrixID" must be set to the default Symmetrix ID to be used
# "storageClass.storageResourcePool" must be set to the default Storage Resource Pool to be used
# "storageClass.serviceLevel" must be set to the default Service Level to be used"
# "storageClass.isDefault" defines whether the primary storage class should be the # default.
# "storageClass.reclaimPolicy" defines what will happen when a volume is removed from the Kubernetes API. Valid values are "Retain" and "Delete".
# "images.driver" defines the container images used for the driver container. IT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO NOT CHANGE THE IMAGES TO BE DOWNLOADED.
